HISTORY

1.1       New things figured out in the usecode part, SCHEDULE.DAT explanation
1.0       First public release

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
DATA TYPES

Simple data types used in the description of the formats:
  char    = unsigned 8 bits representing a character
  shortint= signed 8 bits
  byte    = unsigned 8 bits
  integer = signed 16 bits
  word    = unsigned 16 bits
  longint = signed 32 bits

When describing the format of the data, i will use the following conventions:
A = word [b0=.. bF=..]
  means that A is a word (b0..bF are the description of each bit)
A = nn B
  means that A is composed by nn times B
A = B, C, D
  means that A is composed by B followed by C followed by D
A = set of B
  means that A is composed by a certain number of B
A = B | C
  means that A can be composed by either B or C
xx        (2 hex digits)
  means a byte constant
xxxx      (4 hex digits)
  means a word constant
xxxxxxxx  (8 hex digits)
  means a longint constant

Chunk items = shapes coming from the U7CHUNKS map file
Fixed items = shapes coming from U7IFIX files
Game items  = shapes coming from U7IREG files

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
COLLECTION FILE FORMATS

U7 games make extensive use of Flex Files.
A flex file is a collection of objects, it is composed of:
-a header (128 bytes long)
  header  = title, magic1, count, magic2, d1..d9
  title   = $50 characters (optionnal, filled with 00s)
  magic1  = longint (seems to be always $FFFF1A00)
  count   = longint (number of object in table, including empty objects)
  magic2  = longint (seems to be always $000000CC)
  d1..d9 = longints (often set to 0, but sometimes used, meaning?)
-a table of references
  reference = offset, size
  offset    = longint (relative to the beginning of the file)
  size      = longint
  note: empty objects are referenced as null offset and null size
-the objects data (in the same order as declared in the table)
  the format depends on the object type

U7 games use also IFF files. (Interchange File Format)
An IFF file is a collection of file associated with their type/name.
It is composed of:
-a header (12 bytes long)
  header  = 'FORM', size, type
  size    = reversed longint (size of the file excluding the first 8 bytes)
  type    = 4 chars representing the type of data contained in the IFF file
-the objects entries
  entry   = type, size, object, [even]
  type    = 4 chars representing the type of this object
  size    = reversed longint (size of the entry excluding the first 8 bytes)
  even    = 1 byte (set to 0) present only to get an even number of bytes
  (the objects found in U7 IFF files have the following format:)
  object  = name, data
  name    = 8 chars (filled with 0s)
  data    = the data of the object

U7 games use also table files.
A table file is a collection of object of the same type. It is composed of:
-a table of reference
  reference = info, offset
  info    = 2 bytes (meaning?)
  offset  = longint (relative to the beginning of the file)
-the objects entries (in the same order as declared in the table)
  entry   = size, data
  size    = word (including the size word)
  data    = the data of the object

U7 games use also enumeration files.
An enumeration file is a short collection of data of same type/length
It is composed of:
  enumeration = size, entries
  size    = byte (number of entries)
  entry   = depends of the file, constant length

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMON OBJECTS

Here is a description of the known object type that can be found in
a flex or iff file. Remember that the size of each object is given in the
flex/iff entries so that you can calculate the size of the variant parts
of the object

* Tiles
This is a set of graphic tile representing a certain type of floor that
can appears on the ground in the game view. One tile is 8x8 pixel large
Format:
  tiles = set of tile
  tile  = 8x8 pixel
  pixel = byte (index inside the color palette)

* Shape
This is the graphic representing any item that appears on the game view
except floor tiles. The graphic can include transparent area.
A shape represent a type of object. One shape can have many frames representing
the different appearance of this kind of object. Each frame is describe as a
set of "slices" composing the non-transparent area of the graphic.
A shape can be found in a flex file or as a separate .SHP file
Format:
  shape   = size, set of offset, set of frame
  size    = longint (should be same as in flex table)
  offset  = longint (one for each frame, relative to beginning of shape)
  frame   = rightX, leftX, leftY, rightY, set of slice
    (coordinates are positive distance from the hot spot of the shape)
  slice   = word=0000   (if end of frame)
          | slength, offsetX, offsetY, scontent
    (a slice represents several pixels on the same line)
  slength = word [b0    =type of slice (0=standard, 1=compressed)
                  b1..bF=length in pixel]
  offsetX = integer (relative to hot spot)
  offsetY = integer (relative to hot spot)
  scontent= set of pixel  (if standard slice)
          | set of block  (if compressed slice)
  block   = blength, bcontent
  blength = byte [b0    =type of block (0=standard, 1=repeated pixel)
                  b1..b7=length in pixel]
  bcontent= set of pixel  (if standard block)
          | pixel         (if repeated pixel block)

* Palette
A palette is an array describing the RGB values for 256 color indexes
This format is compatible with the bios call for setting a palette.
A palette can be found in a flex file or as a separate .PAL file
Format:
  palette = 256 rgb
  rgb     = red green blue
  red     = byte (0..3F)
  green   = byte (0..3F)
  blue    = byte (0..3F)

* Font
A font is simply a shape where each frame represents the graphic for each
ASCII letter
Format:
  font    = shape
Note: the number of frame of a shape is not limited to 32 as
      suggested by the U7CHUNKS file

* String
A string is a short single line of text ending with a null char
Format:
  string    = set of char

* Text
A text is a like a text file, composed with lines of characters.
The texts used in the main menu contains backslashed sequences that
indicates the output format of the lines:
      \Px   include picture number x (frame of MAINSHP.FLX shape 14h)
      \C    center line
      \L    left-aligned line
Format:
  text    = set of char (with 0D 0A at end of lines)

* Midi music
There are 2 kind of midi music found in flex files:
-MID music that share the same format as a .MID file
  these musics can be extracted and saved as a .MID file to be played
  for example with Windows Media Player
-XMI music & special effects that share the same format as a .XMI file
  these musics can be extracted and saved as a .XMI file to be played
Note: I don't know of a player for such XMI files but there must be some
      Origin FX screen saver uses these files
The format of such file is beyond the scope of this document

* Vocal speech
This contains a vocal waveform that share the same format as a .VOC file
These speeches can be extracted and saved as a .VOC file to be heared
  for example with WinAmp
The format of such file is beyond the scope of this document

* Drivers
This is used to store various drivers in a flex file, for example sound
cards drivers.
Format: seems to be pure machine code

USECODE

Usecode functions 0..3FF are associated with each shape type. Actions like "double-click", "attack",
"avatar being near", "use something on something", "npc about to die" etc... triggers the function

Usecode functions 401..4FF are associated with NPC 1..255 but it seems that most of the work is done
by the usecode function associated with the shape type of the npc.

Usecode functions 500..5FF are associated with ??

Usecode Machine considerations:
This is a stack-based machine, with local variables (including arguments to functions),
an array of flags, a string register, and 2 context values (ref: the current item/NPC referent,
 event:an integer giving the reason of the usecode call)
NPC referent seems to be the negative value of the npc ID or -356 for the Avatar
The machine can handle arrays, any simple value can be considered as a single value array
Arrays are always 1-based.
Most of the game controlling is done using "native" functions implemented inside the game engine.


Opcode list:
One byte identify the opcode instruction. The following bytes are the instruction parameters.
The length depends on the instruction

List of arguments that can be found after the opcode byte:
argument size description
    2  zero-based index of a local variable (the first local variables are the arguments of the function)
     2  offset inside the code segment, relative to beginning of the next opcode
     2  offset of a string inside the data segment
     1  immediate 8-bits value
     2  immediate 16-bits value
     2  zero-based index of a usecode function inside the links array
 2  number of a usecode function
   2  index of an external function native to the game engine

WHAT REMAINS TO BE EXPLAINED


how does the association "NPC" <-> "FACES.VGA" work
some shapes have different title for each frame (eg: desk items)
what does bit 15 of shapeID mean
some infos about NPCs are not yet found

plus, everywhere you find a "?" in this file, there is something i was unable to figure out.
